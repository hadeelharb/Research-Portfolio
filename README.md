# Research Portfolio

This repository contains a selection of research projects, reports, and writing samples across various fields. Each project demonstrates skills in:

- Research and data analysis
- Document drafting and editing
- Report writing and presentation
- Clear and professional content creation

The projects are organized in folders according to their type, with a brief summary provided for each to highlight objectives, methods, and outcomes.

Feel free to browse the projects to get an overview of my experience and capabilities in research and professional writing.
